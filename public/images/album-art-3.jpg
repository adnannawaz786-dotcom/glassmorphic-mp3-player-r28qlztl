I cannot generate actual image files as I can only create text-based content. The file `public/images/album-art-3.jpg` is a binary image file that needs to be created using image editing software or obtained from an image source.

For a glassmorphic MP3 player project, you would need to:

1. Create or obtain album artwork images (JPG format)
2. Save them in the `public/images/` directory
3. Name them appropriately (album-art-1.jpg, album-art-2.jpg, album-art-3.jpg, etc.)

The images should typically be:
- Square format (e.g., 300x300px or 500x500px)
- Good quality album artwork
- Appropriate for the dark theme aesthetic
- Compressed for web use

You can use placeholder services like Unsplash, create your own artwork, or use royalty-free images for this sample album art.
