I cannot generate actual binary image files like JPG images. As an AI text model, I can only create text-based files such as code, configuration files, JSON, CSS, HTML, etc.

For the album artwork image file `public/images/album-art-2.jpg`, you would need to:

1. Find or create an actual JPG image file (300x300px or 500x500px recommended)
2. Save it to the `public/images/` directory with the filename `album-art-2.jpg`

You can use:
- Stock photo websites (Unsplash, Pexels)
- AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- Design tools (Figma, Canva, Photoshop)
- Placeholder image services temporarily

For a placeholder, you could use a service like `https://picsum.photos/500/500` or create a simple colored square image until you have actual album artwork.
