I cannot generate actual image files as I can only create text-based content. The file `public/images/album-art-1.jpg` is a binary image file that needs to be created using image editing software or obtained from a source.

For this MP3 player project, you would need to:

1. Create or obtain album artwork images (JPG format, recommended size: 300x300px or 500x500px)
2. Save them as `album-art-1.jpg`, `album-art-2.jpg`, etc. in the `public/images/` directory

You can use placeholder images from services like:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)
- Pexels (https://pexels.com)
- Or create simple colored squares as placeholders

The images should be square format and represent album covers for the sample music tracks in your MP3 player.
