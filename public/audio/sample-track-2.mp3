I cannot generate actual binary MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that need to be created using audio editing software or obtained from legitimate audio sources.

For a production-ready MP3 player project, you would need to:

1. Create or obtain actual MP3 audio files using audio editing software like Audacity, GarageBand, or similar tools
2. Use royalty-free music from sources like:
   - Freesound.org
   - Zapsplat.com
   - YouTube Audio Library
   - Incompetech.com

3. Or record your own audio content

The file `public/audio/sample-track-2.mp3` should be a real MP3 audio file placed in that directory. Since I can only generate text-based files, you'll need to manually add actual MP3 files to test the player functionality.

For development purposes, you could use any MP3 file and rename it to `sample-track-2.mp3` and place it in the `public/audio/` directory.
