I cannot generate actual MP3 audio files as they are binary media files that require audio encoding. MP3 files contain compressed audio data that cannot be created through text-based code generation.

To properly set up your glassmorphic MP3 player project, you'll need to:

1. Obtain actual MP3 audio files from:
   - Free music libraries (Freesound, Zapsplat, etc.)
   - Creative Commons music sources
   - Your own recordings
   - Stock music providers

2. Place the MP3 files in the `public/audio/` directory with names like:
   - `sample-track-1.mp3`
   - `sample-track-2.mp3` 
   - `sample-track-3.mp3`

3. Ensure the audio files are properly formatted and web-optimized

The MP3 files should be referenced in your audio player components and playlist configurations, but they must be actual audio files, not generated code.
