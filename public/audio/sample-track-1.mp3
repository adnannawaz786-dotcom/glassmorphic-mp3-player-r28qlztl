I cannot generate actual audio file content as binary data in this text format. Audio files like MP3s are binary files that need to be created using audio software or obtained from audio sources.

For this project, you would need to:

1. Create or obtain a sample MP3 audio file
2. Save it as `sample-track-1.mp3` in the `public/audio/` directory

You could:
- Use audio editing software like Audacity to create a sample track
- Use royalty-free music from sources like Freesound.org or Pixabay
- Generate a simple tone or music using online tools
- Use text-to-speech tools to create a sample audio file

The file should be a standard MP3 format that will work with the HTML5 audio API for the music player functionality.
